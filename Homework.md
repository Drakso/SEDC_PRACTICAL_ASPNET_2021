# OpenSource Ideas App

## Phase 1
* Create an architecture for an ASP.NET Core MVC app for posting anonymous ideas. The architecture can be any architecture that you choose
* An IDEA in the app should contain:
  * Id
  * Title
  * Description
  * UniqueCode
  * DateCreated
* Create only the folders, projects and domain classes only
* **BONUS**: Add it on GitHub

## Phase 2
* Create a database connection using Entity Framework
* Setup context with Dependency Injection
* Add repository for the IDEA model
* Check to see if a database is created by creating migration and updating the database
> Remember: You need to install the neccecary nugets
> Note: If you are using localDB like I did, open the Server Explorer and add the "(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB" as a server to find your database
